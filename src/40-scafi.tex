Scafi \cite{Scafi, scafiphd} is a library defining a Domain Specific Language that integrates the aggregate paradigm into the Scala programming language \cite{Scala}. Like Protelis it runs on the Java Virtual Machine but instead of defining its own language it take advantage of the Scala language and its expressive type system. Scafi unlike the others aggregate programming implementation doesn't have an explicit representation of fields but instead has a notion of "computation against a neighbour", i.e. a computation depending on the evaluation of the same expression by an alligned neighbour. It also provides an integration with Akka \cite{Akka}, a Scala industry-ready actor framework for scalable and resilient message-driven applications.
